## Overview

Welcome to the my project repository! The goal of this project is to develop a dynamic movie recommendation and analysis platform that leverages an interactive chatbot. The chatbot, powered by automation tools, will engage users in a conversational manner to gather preferences, provide real-time recommendations, and enhance the overall user experience. By incorporating automation in the form of a chatbot, the platform aims to create a more personalized and adaptive movie-watching journey for each user.

## Problem Statement

Movie enthusiasts face challenges in discovering personalized content tailored to their individual preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often fall short in capturing the nuanced tastes of users and suffers from data sparsity(the problem of having insufficient or missing ratings or interactions between users and items), leading to a less-than-optimal user experience. Additionally, the static nature of these systems may not effectively adapt to evolving user preferences over time.

To address these issues, this project propose the development of an innovative movie recommendation and analysis platform that integrates an interactive chatbot for user interaction. The success of this platform will be measured by the improvement in the accuracy of movie recommendations provided by the chatbot, assessed through precision and recall metrics.

---

## Success Metric

The success metric will be the improvement in the accuracy of movie recommendations provided by the chatbot. This will be measured using the precision and recall metrics, with a target precision of 0.75 and recall of 0.80 within the first few months of implementing the chatbot. Aiming for this balance ensures that the chatbot not only recommends movies the user is likely to enjoy (high precision) but also doesn't miss out on many movies the user would like (high recall).

--- 

## Target Metric

The target metric will focus on reducing the false-positive rate in movie recommendations generated by the chatbot. The goal is to achieve a 15% decrease in the false-positive rate (out of out of every 10 movie suggestions, approximately 1.55 suggestions are not likely to match the user's preferences if baseline fp rate is 30%), indicating that users receive more accurate and relevant movie suggestions.

---

## Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:** The mean precision and recall of movie recommendations remain unchanged before and after the implementation of the interactive chatbot, suggesting that the chatbot does not significantly impact the accuracy of recommendations.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean precision and recall of movie recommendations significantly improve after the implementation of the interactive chatbot, indicating a positive impact on the accuracy of suggestions.

---

## Methods and Models

**Techniques**
- Collaborative Filtering:  make movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between users or items
- Content-Based Filtering: recommends items based on the features of the items and the user's preferences. I
- Utilize automation tools and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to implement an interactive chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries.
    - Use NLTK for intent recognition (preprocess user input, tokenize it, and identify the intent based on keywords, patterns, or machine learning models)
    - Use NLTK for response generation (response generation mechanism based on the recognized intent that could involve rule-based responses)

**Model Deployment**
- Use web frameworks like Streamlit to deploy the machine learning models and chatbot into a web application. This allows users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
